## Introduction

The Vigenère cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution. In this cipher, each letter in the plaintext is shifted according to a keyword. The keyword determines the shift value for each letter, making the encryption more secure compared to simple substitution ciphers.

This React application provides an easy-to-use interface for entering messages and keywords, allowing you to perform encryption and decryption operations effortlessly.

## Features

- Encrypt plaintext messages using the Vigenère cipher.
- Decrypt Vigenère ciphered messages using the appropriate keyword.
- Copy decrypted messages to the clipboard for easy sharing.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
4. Start the development server using `npm start`.
5. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
6. Enter a message and a keyword, then click the "Encrypt" button to encrypt the message.
7. To decrypt a message, enter the Vigenère ciphered text and the corresponding keyword, then click the "Decrypt" button.
8. The decrypted message will be displayed, and you can click the "Copy to Clipboard" button to copy it.
